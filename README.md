# ContemporaryPeople
## Or, Darwin-Picasso-Eminem (DaPiE?)

A program where you can satisfy all your curosity about which people were alive at the same time, which people are related by one contemporary person, which people are related by two, etc. You can see which scientists were alive at the same time, or view a chain of scientists and find Newton is only 2 generations away from Einstein (I don't know if that's true), or to get an idea of which historical event happened in the same lifetime as an event important to different field. or give rules to make visual representation in form of graphs (vertices and edges kind, not y=f(x) kind).
Might be wishful thinking, but anyway, that's the plan.

Inspired by a single line of a "did you know" fact shared on a group by a friend: "Did you know that Picasso was alive at the same time as Darwin and Eminem?"
